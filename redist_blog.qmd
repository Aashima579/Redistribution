Time poverty is a critical yet often overlooked dimension of poverty. While income poverty measures have long dominated policy discussions, the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP) sheds light on the hidden poor - those who may have sufficient income but lack the time to meet basic needs due to excessive work and household responsibilities.

A recent policy brief from the Levy Economics Institute examines how redistributing household production responsibilities could alleviate time poverty in the United States [@zacharias2024a]. Using LIMTIP data, the brief explores three redistribution scenarios and their potential impacts on time poverty rates and household well-being.

## The Hidden Poor: Time Poverty in the U.S.

The LIMTIP measure reveals that time poverty is a significant issue in the United States, affecting 42.9% of individuals living in time-poor households (@tbl-limtip). Interestingly, time-poor households have lower official income poverty rates (6%) compared to non-time-poor households (17.9%). This suggests a trade-off where households prioritize income generation over time availability.

However, when accounting for the monetized value of time deficits, the LIMTIP adjusted poverty rate for time-poor households rises to 13.1%. This 7.1 percentage point difference represents the hidden poor - those whose income appears sufficient but falls short when considering the resources needed to outsource time-intensive responsibilities.

## Redistribution Scenarios

The policy brief examines three scenarios for redistributing household production responsibilities:

1. Equal Shares: Dividing tasks equally among all working-age household members.
2. Time Available: Allocating responsibilities based on each member's available time after accounting for personal maintenance and paid work.
3. Opportunity Cost: Assigning tasks inversely proportional to each member's earning potential.

These scenarios were applied to different household types, with a focus on heterosexual couples where both partners are working-age (18-64 years) and non-disabled.

## Impact on Time Poverty

The redistribution scenarios show promising results in reducing time poverty, particularly for households where time surpluses exceed deficits. However, the effects vary across household types and scenarios.

### Transition Rates

For couples, the equal shares scenario (Scenario 1) has the highest impact on pushing non-time-poor men into time poverty (26.1%), while having a smaller effect on women (8.3%) (@fig-transition1 and @fig-transition2). This reflects the current unequal distribution of household responsibilities.

The time available scenario (Scenario 2) shows more balanced effects, with similar transition rates for men and women. Interestingly, the opportunity cost scenario (Scenario 3) leads to higher transition rates into time poverty for women (19.8%) compared to men (14.2%), likely due to wage disparities.

For households where everyone is already time-poor (Type I), redistribution has limited impact. However, in households with at least one non-time-poor member (Type II and III), the scenarios show significant potential for reducing time poverty, especially for women.

### Changes in Time Deficits

Beyond transition rates, the brief examines changes in the magnitude of time deficits. For couples, redistribution generally leads to smaller time deficits for women and increased deficits for men, promoting more equitable sharing of responsibilities.

In Type III households (where redistribution can eliminate time poverty), all scenarios significantly reduce time deficits. The time available scenario (Scenario 2) proves most effective, with nearly all couples exiting time poverty.

## Impact on LIMTIP Poverty

Redistribution scenarios also show potential for reducing the incidence of hidden poor. As @fig-limtip1 illustrates, all scenarios decrease the share of hidden poor from 5.7% to 1-2% across all household types combined.

The time available scenario (Scenario 2) emerges as the most effective in reducing hidden poverty. However, for households where all members are time-poor (Type I), redistribution may sometimes increase LIMTIP poverty due to limited room for reallocation.

## Policy Implications

The findings suggest that intra-household redistribution of household production could be an effective tool for reducing time deficits and alleviating time poverty. Key implications include:

1. Context matters: The effectiveness of redistribution policies depends on household composition and existing time poverty status.

2. Equity-based approach shows promise: The time available scenario (Scenario 2) emerged as most effective in reducing poverty rates and enabling individuals to exit poverty.

3. Gender equity: Redistribution promotes more equitable sharing of household responsibilities between men and women.

4. Targeted approaches needed: Future policies should consider more nuanced redistribution strategies, such as focusing on specific age groups or households with children.

5. Complementary measures: While redistribution is promising, it should be part of broader strategies addressing structural factors contributing to time and income poverty.

## Limitations and Future Research

While the policy brief provides valuable insights, several areas warrant further investigation:

1. Composition of household production: Analyzing the specific types of tasks being redistributed could inform more targeted policies (e.g., childcare provision vs. general housework).

2. Age-specific impacts: Examining how redistribution affects younger vs. older household members could help avoid unintended consequences.

3. Long-term effects: Studying the potential impacts of redistribution on labor market outcomes, well-being, and gender norms over time.

4. Cultural factors: Investigating how cultural attitudes and norms influence the feasibility and acceptance of household production redistribution.

5. Policy design: Exploring specific policy interventions that could encourage and support more equitable distribution of household responsibilities.

## Conclusion

The policy brief highlights the often-overlooked issue of time poverty and its impact on household well-being. By incorporating time deficits into poverty measures, the LIMTIP reveals a significant population of hidden poor who struggle to meet basic needs despite having incomes above official poverty thresholds.

Redistributing household production responsibilities shows promise as a strategy for alleviating time poverty, particularly in households where time surpluses can absorb deficits. The equity-based approach, which allocates tasks based on available time, emerges as the most effective in reducing both time and LIMTIP poverty rates.

However, the varying effects across household types and scenarios underscore the need for nuanced, context-specific policies. While redistribution can promote gender equity and improve overall household well-being, it should be considered as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing both time and income poverty.

As policymakers grapple with persistent poverty and inequality, incorporating time poverty measures and exploring innovative solutions like household production redistribution could lead to more effective and holistic anti-poverty strategies. Further research in this area has the potential to uncover new pathways for improving quality of life and promoting economic justice for all.
