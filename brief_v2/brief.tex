This policy brief examines how redistributing household production
responsibilities could reduce time poverty among married U.S. couples.
Using the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP), we
analyze three scenarios based on equality, equity, and opportunity cost
principles. Our findings show that redistribution could effectively
reduce time poverty in households where time surplus exceeds deficits,
with the equity-based approach proving most successful. However,
redistribution has limited impact when all household members are already
time-poor. The effectiveness varies across household structures,
suggesting targeted approaches may work better than universal solutions.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Redistribution of household production, which includes unpaid caregiving
and domestic chores, has been identified as an important tool to achieve
gender equality. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5,
Target 5.4, has incorporated the recognition, reduction, and
redistribution of unpaid work strategy, popularly known as the 3R
strategy. This is a testament to decades of activism and advocacy
emphasizing that gender inequality on this front cannot be simply
justified as a ``private family matter'', but rather be considered a
matter of public policy. Redistribution can take place from households
to the public and/or private spheres, as well as among household
members. While all household members should share household work,
evidence shows that it is disproportionately undertaken by girls and
women globally (Addati et al., 2018).

Redistribution of household production responsibilities from women to
men is important intrinsically for human rights and fairness concerns;
it is also instrumental in achieving gender equality in labor market
outcomes (Bruyn-Hundt, 1996; Elso, 2017; Esquivel, 2016). Studies have
demonstrated that gender gaps in the workforce and the unequal sharing
of household responsibilities can severely impede economic growth and
development (Berik et al., 2009; Duflo, 2012; Elson, 2009). Yet, public
policies and collective actions have been less than adequate, especially
in poorer countries due to constrained fiscal capacity, widespread
absence of formal wage labor, and weak welfare states. Moreover, in
patriarchal contexts, cultural barriers also restrict redistribution of
household production among their members, or redistribution between the
public and private spheres. While in some developed countries such as
Norway and Sweden, public policies have been able to promote
gender-equitable sharing of household production, such as paid paternity
and maternity leaves, they have attained limited attention and success
in other countries.

The U.S. is not an exception. Issues related to lack of public
provisioning of care infrastructure and services, widespread existence
of childcare deserts, and lack of paid parental leave laws, among
others, have drawn attention. In 2021, the value of unpaid household
work in the U.S. amounted to \$600 billion, constituting approximately
2.6\% of the GDP (Reinhard et al., 2023). Moreover, like most other
countries, we observe gender disparity in sharing of household work,
with women being in charge of a disproportionately larger share of the
burden. According to the 2018 American Time Use Survey, among adults
aged 15 and older, women on average spent 5.7 hours per day on unpaid
household and care work, compared with 3.6 hours for men. In other
words, women spent 37 percent more time on unpaid household and care
work than men (Hess et al., 2020).

Unfortunately, the U.S. also falls behind in other dimensions of this
problem. Compared to other OECD countries, the U.S. lacks effective
childcare policies, spending only 0.4\% of GDP on early childhood
education and care (ECEC), compared to the OECD average of 0.8\% (OECD,
2020). The U.S. also lacks federal laws granting paid parental leave,
setting it apart from other OECD nations. Around 51\% of the U.S.
population resides in childcare deserts, defined as census tracts with
more than 50 children under the age of 5 and either no childcare
providers or significantly limited options, resulting in a severe
shortage of licensed child care slots (Malik et al., 2018).

\subsection{What does this mean for time
poverty?}\label{what-does-this-mean-for-time-poverty}

The lack of public provisioning of care infrastructure and services, and
the disproportionate burden of household production on women, has
implications for time poverty, both at the individual and the
household/family level.

\textbf{What do we mean by time poverty?}

Over the last decades, the Levy Economic Institute has been at the
forefront of recognizing the importance of time for understanding income
and poverty dynamics (Zacharias, 2011). As part of this work, they
developed a new measure of poverty that incorporates the dimension of
time into traditional poverty measures: The Levy Institute Measure of
Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP for short). This measure uses synthetic
data in order to incorporate the value of time, or more specifically the
amount of resources required to outsource the responsibilities that
cannot be covered by the household members, into traditional measures of
poverty thresholds. By incorporating this dimension, the LIMTIP not only
provides a more comprehensive understanding of poverty but also allows
for the identification of the hidden poor, i.e., individuals whose
families do not have enough monetary resources to accommodate for the
time deficits they face (Antonopoulos et al., 2017; Masterson, 2012;
Zacharias et al., 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021).

In principle, individual time poverty refers to the lack of time
available for individuals to engage in activities that are essential for
taking care of the household, its members, self-care, and paid work.
This in itself is a difficult concept to grasp, because every individual
has different responsibilities and needs, and thus, different time
constraints. To formalize this definition, LIMTIP assumes that all
individuals have the same time constraints (168 hours per week) that
they need to allocate among household production, personal maintenance,
and paid work. Some of these components are identified based on people's
decisions (i.e., time spent on paid work), but others are assumed to
have some minimum time requirements, such as the case for household
production and personal maintenance. If the responsibilities of an
individual exceed the 168 hours per week,

To identify time poverty at the household level, LIMTIP imposes the
assumption that individuals are unable or unwilling to help those with
time deficits. Thus, even if a single individual struggles to meet their
responsibilities, the whole family is considered to be living under time
poverty. In this framework, as pointed out in
(\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}), it is not uncommon to see households
with a mixture of time availability (i.e., deficits and surpluses) among
its members. In fact, just over 20\% of the working-age population are
not time-poor but live in a household where at least one person lives
under time poverty. Because the LIMTIP assumes household production is
the only component that can be shared among household members, this
mixture of time availability among household members suggests that not
everyone is pulling their weight in terms of household production.

In spite of the growing recognition of the importance of time
constraints and the responsibility of household production, the issue of
time poverty has received limited attention in the U.S., partially due
to data availability constraints.

\textbf{What does this mean for Time Poverty in the U.S.?} While most of
the earlier work on LIMTIP has focused on the analysis of time poverty
in developing countries (Masterson, 2012; Masterson et al., 2022;
Zacharias et al., 2018), recent work has extended the measure to the
U.S. (Zacharias et al., 2024;
\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}).\footnote{This is in addition to the
  work done for the Levy Institute Measure of Economic Well-Being
  (LIMEW).} Similar to earlier work, one of the findings of
(\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}) is that a large share of the
population experiences some level of time poverty, which translates into
a significant share of households who are \textbf{\emph{hidden poor}},
thus not captured by the official income poverty measure. In this policy
brief, we suggest that a significant share of time-poor individuals and
households could potentially exit time poverty if household production
responsibilities were to be redistributed among its members (similar to
Zacharias et al. (2021)).

Following (\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}), this policy brief explores
the potential impacts of redistribution further. Using the new estimates
for LIMTIP for the U.S., we provide insights into how redistributing
household production can reduce the incidence of poverty not only for
individuals but also of the households they live in. Specifically, given
the marked responsibilities gap between men and women, we focus on
analyzing the impact of redistribution among married couples. To do
this, we consider three redistribution scenarios based on equality,
equity, and opportunity cost principles and assess the impact of
redistribution on time poverty of working-age (18-64 years) household
members who are part of a heterosexual couple. Further, we present the
impacts for different household types, household structures (presence of
young children and other members), poverty groups and employment status.

\section{Where we are: Time Poverty in the United
States}\label{where-we-are-time-poverty-in-the-united-states}

Between 2015 and 2019 in the U.S., under LIMTIP definition, an average
of 35.0\% of all households had at least one member who was time poor.
If we restrict this to households with a married couple, this share
increases to 36.1\%, providing a glimpse of the higher prevalence of
time poverty among married couples. This last group consitutes the focus
of our analysis.

Within these time poor housheolds, 52\% of the married couples may be
classified as time poor, with only 7.8\% of other members in the
household experiencing time poverty. From this share of time poor
married couples, only 44\% of married men are experiencing time poverty
compared to 61\% among married women.

\textbf{Who are the couples in this time poor households?}

Table~\ref{tbl-stat} provides an overview of the characteristics of the
households where these couples live. The first type of classification we
consider is one that classifies households in regards to their potential
to exit time poverty via redistribution. We consider three types of
households:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Households where everyone is time poor, thus redistribuion cannot
  eliminate time poverty for the household.
\item
  Households where there is at least one non-time poor individual, but
  its insufficient to eliminate time poverty for the household.
\item
  and, Households where the total time surplus is greater than the total
  time deficit, thus redistribution can eliminate time poverty for all
  members in the household.
\end{itemize}

Overall, 5.2\% of couples live in a household where all members are time
poor, but 76\% could potentially leave time poverty if household
production responsibilities were perfectly redistributed. Over half of
the couples have a young child living with them (56\%) and 25\% have
other members in the household. In terms of employment status, the vast
majority of working-age individuals are employed, with 97\% of husbands
and 91\% of wives are working. This is not surprising, as discussed in
(\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}), for most individuals, time poverty is
driven by the need to work.

\textbf{what about other characteristics?}

As shown in Table~\ref{tbl-stat}, household struture is a critical
factor for understanding if redistribution has the potential to reducing
time poverty. Household with young children have the lowest chance to
exit time poverty (65.5\%), compared to other groups. In contrast, the
presence of other age-able members in household drastically increases
those chances (97.3\%). This is not surprising. The presence of young
children increases the time demands on the child care activities, as
well as overall household activities due to larger size. On the other
hand, the presence of a fall back person for the couple greatly
increases the potential of redistribution, because of of this
``other-members'' do not typically experience time constrains.

A third pattern observed relates to wife employment status. Families
where wives are not currently working show higher potential for time
redistribution reducing time poverty. However, this is also observed
alongside two other characteristics of these families: they tend to have
young children, while also showing a larger proportion of additional
household members present.

\section{Where we are going: Redistribution
Scenarios}\label{where-we-are-going-redistribution-scenarios}

The idea of redistribution of household production responsibilities
follows the principle that everyone in a household should be able to
carry out their \textbf{fair} share of household work. But what
constitutes a fair share? While one could construct many rules and
strategies to redistribute household responsibilities within a
household, we consider three principles that could guide the
redistribution of household production responsibilities among eligible
household members.

For the implementation of these scenarios, we consider that all other
elements in LIMTIP equation remain constant with the exception of
\(\alpha_{ij}\), which is the share of household production time that
each individual \(i\) in Household \(j\) takes on. The goal is to
simulate different \(\alpha_{ij}\) based on each redistribution
scenario, but maintaining the total share of work done by the eligible
household members (all members 18-64). This approach imposes the
implicit assumption that all household members are equally efficient at
taking care of the household responsibilities. We outline the methods
used for implementing the scenarios below.

\subsection{Scenario 1: Equal Shares}\label{scenario-1-equal-shares}

The first scenario considers the impact of redistributing household
production such that all responsibilities are equally distributed across
all eligible household members.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r1}{\alpha_{ij}^E= \frac{1}{I_j}*(1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})
}\end{equation}

where \(\alpha_{ij}^E\) represents the redistributed share of individual
\(i\); \(I^j\) is the number of working-age persons in household \(j\)
and \(\alpha_{j}^{nw}\) represents the total share of all non-working
age household members. While this principle aligns with the idea of
equality, it overlooks time equity by redistributing tasks without
taking into consideration the time available to individuals.

\subsection{Scenario 2: Time Available}\label{scenario-2-time-available}

The time available scenario is based on the principles of equity. In
contrast with Scenario 1, this one suggests that household
responsibilities should be redistributed relative to the available time
individuals may have after setting aside the time for personal
maintenance requirements, and income generation
(\(Z_{ij}=168-M-D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij})\)).

To implement this, we first calculate the time available (\(Z_{ij}\))
for each individual and recalculate the shares \(\alpha_{ij}^A\) using
the ratio of time available to the total time available among
working-age members. For individuals that do not have any time available
(\(Z_{ij}<0\)), we set it at zero. This ensures that people who already
suffer from time poverty are not assigned further tasks within the
household. The new share is defined as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r2}{
\begin{aligned}
Z_{ij} &=\max{\Big(168-M-D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij}-E_{ij}(S_{ij}),0\Big)} \\
\alpha_{ij}^A &= \frac{Z_{ij}}{\sum Z_{ij}} (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

Because there are individuals (young adults) who may still be in school,
we adapt the definition of \(Z_{ij}\) by discounting from their
available time the average number of hours people spend in education
activities per week (\(S_{ij}\)). This correction does not affect the
time balance used for the identification of the time poor, only the
estimation of time available and the adjusted shares \(\alpha_{ij}^A\).

\subsection{Scenario 3: Opportunity
Cost}\label{scenario-3-opportunity-cost}

The third possibility is based on the idea of opportunity costs along
marginalist lines. The sharing rule depends on the earning potentials of
individuals, such that individuals with higher potential wages are
assigned a lower share of household production time. In principle, this
would encourage the most productive members of the household to spend
more time in paid work, while those with lower earning potentials would
take on more household production responsibilities. However, because we
do not implement any changes in the time spend on paid work, we could
also interpret this scenario as a bargaining case where members with the
highest potential earnings are able to negotiate a lower share of
household production time.

For example, if there are only three working-age adults in a household,
and where the second member earns twice as much as the first, and the
third earns three times as much as the first, the shares of household
production would be 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 respectively. To implement this
scenario, we first calculate the inverse of the wage of each individual
\(rw_{ij}\), and then calculate the share of household production time
as follows:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r3}{\begin{aligned}
rw_{ij} &= \frac{1}{w_{ij}}, \ 
\alpha_{ij}^O &= \frac{rw_{ij}}{\sum rw_{ij}} (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

where \(w_{ij}\) is the wage of individual \(i\).

Because wage data is not observed for all household members, we use
potential/predicted wages for all working-age household members, based
on a two step procedure. First, we predict the occupation and industry
likelihood for non-working individuals, and second, we model and predict
wages for all household members using a method (heckman selection -
Heckman (1979)) that accounts why some people choose not to work in the
first place (self-selection). These predicted wages serve as our measure
of how valuable each person's time is.

\section{Impact of Redistribution}\label{impact-of-redistribution}

Because there are many household members that could potentially take on
more household production responsibilities, the potential for
redistribution is high. However, the effectiveness depends considerably
on characteristics of the household, such as the presence of children,
the presence of other members, and the employment status of the wife.
Furthermore, because the redistribution scenarios are based on a
zero-sum game, there are individuals that may not benefit from
redistribution.

In terms of incidence of time poverty, see Table~\ref{tbl-tb2}, women
benefit more from redistribution than men, except under Scenario 3. This
shows that even the simplistic redistribution rules we defined, the
gender wage gap has important implications in terms of women's time
poverty. In terms of numbers, the simulations suggest that Scenario 2 is
the most effective in reducing time poverty for both men and women,
bringing the share of time poor individuals to 29.6\% (men) and
26.4\%(women).

These improvements do not come without casualties. Among non-time poor
men (baseline), we estimate that up 23\% of them could enter time
poverty under redistribution scenario 1, with a lower end of 13.7\%
under scenario 3. In contrast, while there is generally a smaller rate
of women falling into time poverty , the transition into poverty rate
under scenario 3 (16.3\%) is higher than that observed for men. This
reinforces the idea that gaps in opportunity costs/bargaining power can
have important implications for the redistribution of time could affect
time poverty.

The general structure of the household also plays an important role in
the effectiveness of redistribution. Even in cases where everyone in the
household is time poor, redistribution can still reduce the time poverty
status individuals. While this improvements are small for men, there are
significant reductions in time poverty for women under the equal shares
scenarios (Scenario 1). As we will see later, however, this should not
be interpreted as a general improvement, as someone else in the
household will have to take on the extra responsibilities, and thus
increasing their own and the household time decifit.

The results that appear to be the most paradoxical relate to households
where there are non-time poor individuals, but the total time surplus is
not enough to eliminate time poverty. Based on individual time poverty
alone, it may seem that all redistribution scenarios have a negative
impact on both husbands and wives. This, however, is also in contrast
with the fact that time deficits would be decreasing, despite the
increase in time poverty incidence.

Lastly, for household that can exit time poverty, most of their members
(husband and wife) will exit time poverty. And just as described before,
both men and women benefit greatly under Scenario 2, with scenario 1
being the least favorable for men, and scenario 3 the least favorable
for women.

\textbf{The role of household Structure}

The results we just presented provides us with an overall picture of the
potential of redistribution to reduce time poverty. However, the
effectiveness of redistribution also depends on the structure of the
household. There are two factors, as observed in Table~\ref{tbl-tb3},
that are important to understand how effective redistribution can be:
the presence of young children and the presence of other members in the
household.

On the one hand, presence of young children (14 years or younger) will
have a large impact on the requirements of household production, mostly
in the form of child care activities, without the possibility of the
children taking on any of the responsibilities.\footnote{By
  construction, the ATUS does not collect information on time use of
  individuals younger than 15} On the other hand, if there are other
members in the household, the potential for redistribution is higher, as
these members could potentially take on some of the responsibilities of
the couple.

Interestingly, at baseline, the presence of children, and presence of
other household members, are weakly associated with time poverty
differences across husband and wife. The small differences we observe
are as expected, with somewhat higher levels of time poverty across
households with children, and households without other members.

\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

When considering the impact of the redistribution scenarios, we find a
clear pattern that the presence of children and absence of other members
have a very similar impact reducing the effectiveness of redistribution
scenarios. In both cases, the reduction in time poverty we estimate for
women is still larger than that for men. This highlights how much more
work women do in taking care of the household, specially providing
primary child are, as well as absorbing most of the responsibilities of
the household production, when there are no other members to share the
responsabilities. This also explains why, when redistribution is
applied, the reduction in time poverty is more limited for husbands.

\textbf{Income and Emplyoment}

One last aspect to consider is to analyze if there is any heterogeneity
in the estimated impact of redistribution based on the household overall
income or the employment status of the wife. We do not consider the
employment status of the husband, because 97.2\% of husbands are
employed, and thus, there is little variation to analyze. We should also
remember that we concentrate on households that are time poor, and thus
are less likely to be income poor, because one or both of the partners
are employed.

\hline\hline
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

We first consider the impact of redistribution based on the household
income, or more specifically, the income-to-poverty-line ratio.
Interestingly, it may seem that time poverty, at baseline, does not
discriminate across income groups, showing similar levels across the
income distribution. Although we do observe a slightly lower share of
time poor women (55.9\%) in the lowest income group, compared to average
of 61.0\%.

For men, there is very little variation in the impact of redistribution
across income groups for scenarios 1 and 3. It may seem that men will
either increase their share of household production (Scenario 1) or will
take advantage of the opportunity cost of time (Scenario 3), regardless
of the income. For Scenario 2, however, we observe that redistribution
is more effective in reducing time poverty for those in the lowest
income group.

What is more interesting is that the same pattern of decreasing
effectiveness of redistribution policies is also observed among women,
for all scenarios. A possible explanation is that the share of employed
men does not vary much across income groups. However, the share of
non-employed women goes from 30\% in the lowest income group, to 5\% in
the highest income group. This means that for people in the highest
income group, there is less room for redistribution because both husband
and wife are employed. However, because women still take on most of the
household production, the impact of redistribution is still higher for
them compared to men

\textbf{What about the Hidden Poor?}

One of the main contributions of the LIMTIP is the identification of the
hidden poor, i.e., individuals who are not classified as poor based on
official poverty estimates but are classified as such when one accounts
for the time deficits they face. For our sample, we estimate that 4.7\%
of the population who is not classified as officially poor, fall under
this definition with when we adjust time deficits. However, if any of
the redistribution scenarios were to be implemented, the share of hidden
poor could be reduced to 1.8-0.7\%.

When considering household characteristics, redistribution scenarios
could actually increase hidden poverty in households where everyone is
time poor, but can be greatly reduced whenever there is room for
redistribution. For example, if the household has the potential to exit
time poverty, redistribution based on the time available principle could
almost eliminate the share of hidden poor (0.1\%).

Lastly, when the wife is working, redistribution based on equal shares
or opportunity cost are almost ineffective in reducing the share of
hidden poor, probably because the wife is already doing the bulk of
household production, and redistribution would only increase the time
poverty of other members. However, if she is working, as is the case for
91\% of the sample, redistribution will help reduce the double burden of
time women face.

\section{Policy Implications: Opportunities and
Challenges}\label{policy-implications-opportunities-and-challenges}

The findings in this policy brief suggest that intra-household
redistribution of household production is a potentially effective tool
to reduce time deficits and alleviate time poverty for individuals and
households. Our findings show that such redistributions can have
significant well-being effects, promoting more equitable sharing of
household responsibilities between men and women and, in some cases,
lifting entire households out of poverty.

However, the effectiveness of redistribution policies is contingent on
the type and structure of households. For instance, in households where
all members are time-poor, redistribution may not be effective and could
potentially (slightly) increase LIMTIP poverty. In contrast, households
with sufficient time surpluses to absorb time deficits can effectively
eliminate time poverty under any of the proposed redistribution
policies. Moreover, presence of chilren in housheodls would call and
xxx.. Among the three redistribution scenarios considered, the
equity-based approach emerged as the most effective in reducing poverty
rates and enabling individuals to exit poverty.

While redistribution policy may be difficult to implement, public
polices can help target inequalities in terms of ``time availability''
and ``opportunity cost'' experienced by men and women, which are a
result of gender discriminatory vicious cycle that hinders equal
educational opportunities for women leading to unequal occupation
opportunities as well as earning cabailities (Sinha and Sedai (2024)).
Policy initiatives that can contribute towards a more gender-equitable
sharing of hosuehold production can be segregated into three broad
categories:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Labor market or employment policies to reduce gender disparity: This
  would involve targetting equal pay at work for men and women and
  ensuring elimination of gender discrimination at workplace. Moreover,
  long-working hours that directly impact time constraints may also need
  to be regulated.
\item
  Public investment in care infrastructure and services: This can be
  helpful as it can contribute toward reducing the required hours of
  household production that determine people's time deficits and time
  poverty. Efforts can involve provisioning of quality childcare
  services at subsidized rates and can even be extended to a universal
  and centralized provisioning of care services. In addition, parental
  leave laws offering not only maternity leave benefits but those
  combined with paternity leaves may serve to have more gender-equitable
  effects on household division of labor.
\item
  Targeting social norms: Gender disparity in labor market are guided by
  gender norms defining gender roles. Targeting norms could involve
  educational interventions during early schooling years, gender
  equitable knowledge-sharing as part of couple counseling on how gender
  norms can be detrimental for the overall well-being and deevlopment of
  the society and the economy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion/recommendations}\label{conclusionrecommendations}

This policy brief has examined the potential of redistributing household
production responsibilities to alleviate time poverty in the United
States. Using the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty
(LIMTIP), we have shown that time poverty is a significant issue
affecting 38.7\% of individuals living in time-poor households. Our
analysis of three redistribution scenarios - based on equality, equity,
and opportunity cost principles - reveals that such redistributions can
significantly reduce time poverty, particularly in households where time
surpluses exceed time deficits.

These findings underscore the importance of integrating time poverty in
poverty alleviation efforts. They also highlight the potential of
intra-household redistribution as a policy tool to promote gender
equality and improve overall household well-being. However, the varying
effects across household types, household structures, poverty groups and
employment status of wives, along with variations across redistribution
scenarios suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal
and a targeted tailored approach is needed.

In conclusion, while redistribution of household production is promising
in alleviating time poverty, and the hidden poor, it should be
considered as part of strategies that also addresses societal and
structural factors affecting to time and income poverty.
