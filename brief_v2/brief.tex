This policy brief examines the potential of redistributing household
production responsibilities to alleviate time poverty in the United
States. Using the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty
(LIMTIP), the brief explores three redistribution scenarios based on
equality, equity, and opportunity cost principles. We focus on what
happens to married men and women by assessing their time poverty, time
deficits, transition rates out of poverty among other outcomes. Findings
indicate that redistribution can significantly reduce time poverty for
xx and xx, particularly in households with/without children???. The
equity-based approach emerges as most effective in reducing poverty
rates overall. Redistribution is found to be less impactful in
households where all members are already time-poor. The brief highlights
how redistribution can promote more equitable sharing of
responsibilities between men and women and potentially lift entire
households out of poverty. However, effects vary across the structure of
the household and difefernt scenarios, suggesting a one-size-fits-all
approach may not be optimal.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

RRR and time poverty

What is LIMTIP? What is Time Poverty?

Explain LIMTIP (Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty),
focusing on how time poverty affects households with couples. Introduce
the main question: ``To what extent can the redistribution of
responsibilities within households reduce time poverty?''

Redistribution of household production, which includes unpaid caregiving
and domestic chores, has been identified as an important tool to achieve
gender equality. The incorporation of the 3R (recognition, reduction,
and redistribution) strategy as a target in the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals is a testament to decades of activism and
advocacy emphasizing that gender inequality on this front cannot be
justified as a ``private family matter'' but is rather a matter of
public policy. Redistribution can take place from households to the
public and/or private spheres, as well as among household members. While
all household members may share household work, evidence shows that it
is disproportionately undertaken by girls and women globally (Addati et
al., 2018).

Redistribution of household production responsibilities from women to
men is important intrinsically for human rights and fairness concerns;
it is also instrumental in achieving gender equality in labor market
outcomes (Bruyn-Hundt, 1996; Elso, 2017; Esquivel, 2016). Studies have
demonstrated that gender gaps in the workforce and the unequal sharing
of household responsibilities can severely impede economic growth and
development (Berik et al., 2009; Duflo, 2012; Elson, 2009). Yet, public
policies and collective actions have been less than adequate, especially
in poorer countries with constrained fiscal capacity, widespread absence
of formal wage labor, and weak welfare states. Moreover, in patriarchal
contexts, cultural barriers restrict redistribution of household
production, particularly unpaid care work from women to men and to the
public and private spheres. While in some developed countries such as
Norway and Sweden, public policies have been able to promote
gender-equitable sharing of household production, such as paid paternity
leaves in addition to paid maternity leaves, they have attained limited
attention and success in other countries.

The U.S. is not an exception. Issues related to lack of public
provisioning of care infrastructure and services, widespread existence
of childcare deserts, and lack of paid parental leave laws, among
others, have gained momentum. In 2021, the value of unpaid household
work in the U.S. amounted to \$600 billion, constituting approximately
2.6\% of the GDP (Reinhard et al., 2023). Moreover, like most other
countries, we observe gender disparity in sharing of household work such
that women disproportionately shoulder the burden. According to the 2018
American Time Use Survey, among adults aged 15 and older, women on
average spent 5.7 hours per day on unpaid household and care work,
compared with 3.6 hours for men. In other words, women spent 37 percent
more time on unpaid household and care work than men (Hess et al.,
2020). Additionally, the U.S. falls behind many OECD countries in
effective childcare policies, spending only 0.4\% of GDP on early
childhood education and care (ECEC), compared to the OECD average of
0.8\% (OECD, 2020). Notably, the U.S. lacks federal laws granting paid
parental leave, setting it apart from other OECD nations. Around 51\% of
the U.S. population resides in childcare deserts, defined as census
tracts with more than 50 children under the age of 5 and either no
childcare providers or significantly limited options, resulting in a
severe shortage of licensed child care slots (Malik et al., 2018).

The lack of public provisioning of care infrastructure and services, and
the disproportionate burden of household production on women, has
implications for time poverty, both at the individual and the
household/family level. Individual time poverty refers to the lack of
time available for individuals to engage in activities that are
essential for taking care of the household, its members, self-care, and
paid work. At the household level, even if a single individual struggles
to meet their responsibilities, the whole family is considered to be
living under time poverty. In this framework, as pointed out in
(\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}), it is not uncommon to see households
with a mixture of time availability (i.e deficts and surpluses) among
its members. In fact, just over 20\% of the working-age population are
not time-poor but live in a household where at least one person lives
under time poverty. In spite of the growing recognition of the
importance of time constraints and the responsibility of household
production, the issue of time poverty has received limited attention in
the U.S., partially due to data availability constraints.

Over the last decades, the Levy Economic Institute has been at the
forefront of recognizing the importance of time for understanding income
and poverty dynamics (Zacharias, 2011). As part of this work, they
developed a new measure of poverty that incorporates the dimension of
time into traditional poverty measures: The Levy Institute Measure of
Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP for short). This measure uses synthetic
data in order to incorporate the value of time, or more specifically the
amount of resources required to outsource the responsibilities that
cannot be covered by the household members, into traditional measures of
poverty thresholds. By incorporating this dimension, the LIMTIP not only
provides a more comprehensive understanding of poverty but also allows
for the identification of the hidden poor, i.e., individuals whose
families do not have enough monetary resources to accommodate for the
time deficits they face (Antonopoulos et al., 2017; Masterson, 2012;
Zacharias et al., 2012, 2014, 2018, 2021).

While most of the earlier work on LIMTIP has focused on the analysis of
Time Poverty in developing countries (Masterson, 2012; Masterson et al.,
2022; Zacharias et al., 2018), recent work has extended the measure to
the U.S. (Zacharias et al., 2024;
\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}).\footnote{This is in addition to the
  work done for the Levy Institute Measure of Economic Well-Being
  (LIMEW).} Similar to earlier work, one of the findings of
(\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}) is that a large share of the
population experiences some level of time poverty, which translates into
a significant share of households who are \textbf{\emph{hidden poor}},
thus not captured by the official income poverty measure. In this policy
brief, we suggest that a significant share of time-poor individuals and
households could potentially exit time poverty if household production
responsibilities were to be redistributed among its members (similar to
Zacharias et al. (2021)).

Following (\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}), this policy brief explores
this possibility further. Using the new estimates for LIMTIP for the
U.S., we provide insights into how redistributing household production
can reduce the incidence of poverty not only for individuals but also of
the households they live in. Specifically, given the marked
responsibilities gap between men and women, we focus on analyzing the
benefits of redistribution among married couples. To do this, we
consider three redistribution scenarios based on equality, equity, and
opportunity cost principles and assess the impact of redistribution on
time poverty of working-age (18-64 years) household members who are part
of a heterosexual couple.

In the next section, we start by briefly describing the LIMTIP measure
and our estimates for the US. We then move on to identifying the
different types of households experiencing time poverty, the
redistribution scenarios, followed by results and policy implications.

\section{LIMTIP: A New Measure of Time Poverty for the United
States}\label{limtip-a-new-measure-of-time-poverty-for-the-united-states}

Poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond the simple notion
of lack of income. In addition to income, poverty can be understood as a
lack of access to resources, including time. The LIMTIP is a metric
that, in addition to income poverty, incorporates aspects of time
poverty that better capture the control households have over their
resources. In this framework, time poverty refers to a scenario wherein
people may not have any time left after engaging in activities that are
essential for taking care of the household, its members, self-care, and
paid work. At the household level, we consider an even more restrictive
definition. Under the assumption that individuals with time surpluses
are unable or unwilling to help those with time deficits, we consider a
household to be time-poor if at least one member is time-poor.

As described in (\textbf{policybrief\_USLIMTIP?}) and
(\textbf{wp\_qmatch?}), the LIMTIP is built using a synthetic dataset
that combines information from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and
the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) of the Current
Population Survey (CPS). For the identification of time poverty, using
weekly hours as the unit of analysis (168 hrs per week), we identify the
amount of time individuals would have left (\(X_{ij}\)) after engaging
in required activities for taking care of their share of
responsibilities (\(\alpha_{ij}\)) in household production (\(R_j\)),
personal maintenance (\(M\)), and paid work (commuting \(T_{ij}\) and
time spent at work \(L_{ij}\)). This is expressed in the following
equation (see Equation~\ref{eq-bal}):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bal}{X_{ij} = 168 - M - \alpha_{ij}R_j-D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij})
}\end{equation}

The minimum time required for each of the components in
Equation~\ref{eq-bal} are estimated using a mixture of assumptions, the
synthetic dataset, and the ATUS dataset (see (\textbf{wp\_qmatch?}) for
details). An individual is classified as time poor if they have a a
negative time balance based on equation Equation~\ref{eq-bal}.

At the household level, however, we assume that individuals with time
surpluses are unable or unwilling to share and redistribute some of the
responsibilities of those with time deficits. In this framework, a
household is considered to be time-poor as long as there is atleast one
person with a time deficit living in the household.\footnote{To identify
  time poverty status, we only consider the time deficits of household
  members age 18 or older.} This is expressed in the following equation
(see Equation~\ref{eq-hbal}):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-hbal}{X_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{I_j} \min(X_{ij},0)
}\end{equation}

Once household time deficits \(X_{j}\) are identified, we can adjust the
official income poverty thresholds to account for the monetized value of
the time deficits. For the U.S. case, we use a three-year average hourly
wage for the industry private households obtained from Merged Outgoing
Rotation Groups (MORG) to value the household time deficit. This value
represents the amount of income that may be required to outsource some
of the time responsibilities and eliminate time poverty. The adjusted
poverty line is then calculated as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-limtip}{Z_{j}^{adj} = Z_{j} + 52*P* |X_{j}|
}\end{equation}

where \(P\) is the price we use to give a monetary value to the time
deficits the household \({j}\) faces, \(Z_{j}\) is the official poverty
line (SPM Poverty line), and \(Z_{j}^{adj}\) is the adjusted poverty
line. Intuitively, households that are not time-poor will not change
status compared to the official poverty estimates. However, households
that are time-poor could have their poverty status change if, after
considering the adjusted poverty line, they fall below it. This group of
households is considered to be the hidden poor.

\section{Redistribution Scenarios}\label{redistribution-scenarios}

The idea of redistribution of household production responsibilities
follows the principle that everyone in a household should be able to
carry out their \textbf{fair} share of household work. But what
constitutes a fair share? In this section, we present three different
principles that could guide the redistribution of household production
responsibilities among eligible household members.

First, we use the simple egalitarianism principle that involves an equal
division of total household production time among all working-age
members. Second, we redistribute responsibilities based on the time
available to household members. In the third scenario, redistribution is
guided based on the principle of opportunity cost of time, where those
with higher wages (higher opportunity cost of time) are assigned less
household production time.

For all scenarios, we only consider the redistribution of required
household production activities \(R_j\) net of the portion met by
household members that are either disabled or are not part of the
working-age population. Thus, the goal is to simulate different
\(\alpha_{ij}\) values, which represent the share of required household
production time that each household member takes on. We also impose the
assumption that all household members are equally efficient at taking
care of the household responsibilities. We outline the methods used for
implementing the scenarios below.

\subsection{Scenario 1: Equal Shares}\label{scenario-1-equal-shares}

The first scenario considers the impact of redistributing household
production such that all working-age members of the household are
assigned an equal share of the required household production time. The
new share is defined as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r1}{\alpha_{ij}^E= \frac{1}{I_j}*(1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})
}\end{equation}

where \(\alpha_{ij}^E\) represents the redistributed share of individual
\(i\); \(I^j\) is the number of working-age persons in household \(j\)
and \(\alpha_{j}^{nw}\) represents the total share of all non-working
age household members. While this principle aligns with the idea of
equality, it overlooks time equity by redistributing tasks without
taking into consideration the time available to individuals.

\subsection{Scenario 2: Time Available}\label{scenario-2-time-available}

The time available scenario is based on the principles of equity. In
contrast with Scenario 1, this one suggests that household
responsibilities could be redistributed relative to the available time
individuals may have after setting aside the time for personal
maintenance requirements and income generation
(\(Z_{ij}=168-M-D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij})\)).

To implement this, we first calculate the time available (\(Z_{ij}\))
for each individual and recalculate the shares \(\alpha_{ij}^A\) using
the ratio of time available to the total time available among
working-age members. For individuals that do not have any time available
(\(Z_{ij}<0\)), we set their \(Z_{ij}\) to zero. This ensures that
people who already suffer from time poverty are not assigned further
tasks within the household. The new share is defined as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r2}{
\begin{aligned}
Z_{ij} &=\max{\Big(168-M-D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij}-E_{ij}(S_{ij}),0\Big)} \\
\alpha_{ij}^A &= \frac{Z_{ij}}{\sum Z_{ij}} (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

Because there are individuals (young adults) who may still be in school,
the standard definition of \(Z_{ij}\) may not capture their true time
availability. To address this, we add a correction to time availability
for all individuals who declared attending school, subtracting from
their available time (\(Z_{ij}\)) the average number of hours people
spend in education activities per week (\(S_{ij}\)). This correction
does not affect the time balance used for the identification of the time
poor, only the estimation of time available and the adjusted shares
\(\alpha_{ij}^A\).

\subsection{Scenario 3: Opportunity
Cost}\label{scenario-3-opportunity-cost}

The third possibility is based on the idea of opportunity costs along
marginalist lines. The sharing rule depends on the earning potentials of
individuals, such that individuals with higher potential wages are
assigned a lower share of household production time. In principle, this
would encourage the most productive members of the household to spend
more time in paid work, while those with lower earning potentials would
take on more household production responsibilities.

For example, if there are only three working-age adults in a household,
and where the second member earns twice as much as the first, and the
third earns three times as much as the first, the shares of household
production would be 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 respectively. To implement this
scenario, we first calculate the inverse of the wage of each individual
\(rw_{ij}\), and then calculate the share of household production time
as follows:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r3}{\begin{aligned}
rw_{ij} &= \frac{1}{w_{ij}} \\
\alpha_{ij}^O &= \frac{rw_{ij}}{\sum rw_{ij}} (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})
\end{aligned}
}\end{equation}

where \(w_{ij}\) is the wage of individual \(i\).

Because we do not observe wage data for non-working household members,
we use the potential/predicted wages for all working-age household
members. To do this, we use a two-step procedure. First, we predict
occupation and industry probabilities for all non-working individuals
using a multinomial logit model. Second, we estimate a maximum
likelihood Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979) using the observed
and predicted probabilities of belonging to specific occupations and
industries, in addition to individual, household, and spouse demographic
characteristics. With this information, we predict wages based on the
model that corrects for sample selection and use those wages as proxies
for the opportunity cost of time \(w_{ij}\).

\section{Impact of Redistribution on Time Poverty: Time Povery and time
deficits}\label{impact-of-redistribution-on-time-poverty-time-povery-and-time-deficits}

Table~\ref{tbl-tb2} Panel 1 presents the share of married men and women
experiencing time poverty. As expected more married women experience
time poverty compared to married men (66\% vs.~44\%). With
redistribution, time poverty can be reduced for married me and married
women across all three scenarios, and by a greater margin for women
compared to men. This in turn reduces gender disparity for couples. In
other words, there is potential to redistribute household production
away from couples to other members in the household.

Rows 2 and 3 in table 2 presents the transition rates i.e entry to and
exit from time poverty respectively. Those who are non-time poor in the
baseline, some of them enters time poverty in all three scenarios, with
more married men entering poverty compared to women except for in
scenario 3, where 16 \% women became time poor compared to 13.7\% men.
Looking at the transition out of time poverty for those who were time
poor in the baseline, we find that more women exited time poverty
compared to men. For example, in Scenario 1, 42\% men exited poverty
compared to 75\% women, whereas in scenario 2, 70 \% men exited compared
to 60 \% women and in Scenario 3, the exit rates were similar for both
men and women at about 60 \%.

In Panel 2 of table 2, we present the poverty rates by household type.
Clearly household type III where there is a mix of time poor and time
non poor individuals such that the total surplus outweighs the total
time deficit, redistribution is most effective, particularly in scenario
2.

Perhaps add a table with all changes in time poverty for each scenario
and sub groups. Or do 3 , one for each scenario.

We now look at how these time poverty rates changes by household
structure. In Table~\ref{tbl-tb3}, we present the time poverty rates by
presence of children and presence of other members, both of which are
critical drivers of couples' time poverty incidence. Presence of young
household children would demand more time to be spent on hh production,
while presence of other members can off shoulder some of the hh
production work from couples. While presence of children is expected to
increase time poverty the latter is expected to decrease time poverty
for couples. At the baseline 63\% women experience time poverty compared
to 44 \% men when children are present, and in absence of children, time
poverty is similar for men 43\% and lower for women at 59\%. In both
cases share of time poor women is greater. With redistribution, time
poverty reduces among married women by a greater margin compared to
married men.

Moreover, when other members are present in the hh time poverty is lower
compared to when no other member is present. All three-redistribution
scenario reduces time poverty, particularly being more effective in
scenario 2 and when other members are present.

Adjusted Income Poverty In Table~\ref{tbl-tb4}, we look at the time
poverty rate by poverty groups and employment/ earning status of wife.
We find that poverty rates are higher among married women compared to
married men across all poverty groups. Gender disparity is lowest among
below poverty group and increases for income-poverty ratio groups 1-2 \%
and 2-4\% bands before declining for over 4\% band.\\
Redistribution across all three scenarios reduces time poverty, more so
for women and most effectively in scenario 1 followed by scenarios 2 and
3.

In Panel 2 of Table~\ref{tbl-tb4}, interestingly we find that when wife
is working time poverty among men is much lower compared to women (40\%
vs.~66\%). With redistribution , time poverty decrease for both, thereby
also reducing gender disparity between couples, except for in scenario 3
where even after redistribution 35\% women experience time poverty
compared to 24\% men. This in turn indicates the vicious cycle exerted
by labor market inequality reflected in earnings which then translates
into assigning greater share of household production to women given that
they earn lower wages, which then also affect their labor market
participation and occupational segregation.

Statistics on the hidden poor Finally, in Table~\ref{tbl-tb5}, we look
at share of hidden poor, i.e share of housheolds who are not counted as
poor according to the official poverty line but are classified as poor
based on LIMTIP calculations because of individuals' time poverty. At
the baseline, 4.7 \% hh are hidden poor. With redistribution we can
decrease the share of hidden poor and make them visible in poverty
alleviation programs. Scenario 2 is most effective in reducing the share
of hidden poor. xxxx {[}To add{]}

\section{Policy Implications: Opportunities and
Challenges}\label{policy-implications-opportunities-and-challenges}

Redistribution can reduce time poverty, but only so much

Which is more effective? Are the results consistent with expectations?

What about based on household characteristics?

\section{Conclusion/recommendations}\label{conclusionrecommendations}

This policy brief has examined the potential of redistributing household
production responsibilities to alleviate time poverty in the United
States. Using the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty
(LIMTIP), we have shown that time poverty is a significant issue
affecting 38.7\% of individuals living in time-poor households. Our
analysis of three redistribution scenarios - based on equality, equity,
and opportunity cost principles - reveals that such redistributions can
significantly reduce time poverty, particularly in households where time
surpluses exceed time deficits.

These findings underscore the importance of considering time poverty in
poverty alleviation efforts. They also highlight the potential of
intra-household redistribution as a policy tool to promote gender
equality and improve overall household well-being. However, the varying
effects across household types, hosuheold structures, poverty groups and
employment status of wives, along with variations across redistribution
scenarios suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal
and a targetted tailored approach is needed.

In conclusion, while redistribution of household production is promising
in alleviating time poverty, and the hidden poor, it should be
considered as part of strategies that also addresses societal and
structural factors that contribute to time and income poverty.
