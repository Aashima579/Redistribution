1. Strengthen the theoretical framework:

   - Expand on the concept of time poverty and its relationship to income poverty in the introduction. 
   - Provide a more comprehensive literature review on time use, household production, and gender inequalities in unpaid work.
   - Develop clearer hypotheses based on existing theories and prior research.

2. Enhance methodological rigor:
 
   - Provide more details on the data sources, sample selection, and variable construction.
   - Explain the LIMTIP methodology more thoroughly, including its assumptions and limitations.
   - Include sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results under different assumptions.
       - Perhaps play around the Redistributing policies
       - Or the Time poverty threshold

4. Improve statistical analysis:

   - Provide confidence intervals or standard errors for key estimates.
       - CI's may be difficult
   - Conduct formal statistical tests to compare outcomes across different scenarios.
       - Yes, could be useful
  
6. Enhance the discussion section:
   - Relate findings more explicitly to existing literature and theories.
   - Discuss limitations of the study more thoroughly.

7. Improve structure and formatting:
   - Reorganize sections to follow a more standard academic paper format (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
   - Ensure all tables and figures are properly numbered, titled, and referenced in the text.
   - Move some technical details to appendices to improve readability of the main text.
        - Imputation, and LIMTIP Construction

9.  Improve language and style:
   - Adopt a more formal academic tone throughout.
   - Ensure consistent use of terminology.
  
10. Update and expand references:
    - Ensure all citations are up to date and relevant.
    - Include more recent studies on time use and poverty.
    - Consider citing relevant theoretical works to strengthen the conceptual framework.

11. Include a separate section on limitations and future research:
    - Discuss data limitations more explicitly.

12. Consider adding a theoretical model:
    - Develop a simple economic model to formalize the relationship between time allocation, household production, and poverty.
