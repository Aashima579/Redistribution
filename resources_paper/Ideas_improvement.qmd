1. Strengthen the theoretical framework:

   - Expand on the concept of time poverty and its relationship to income poverty in the introduction. 
   - Provide a more comprehensive literature review on time use, household production, and gender inequalities in unpaid work.
   - Develop clearer hypotheses based on existing theories and prior research.

2. Enhance methodological rigor:
 
   - Provide more details on the data sources, sample selection, and variable construction.
   - Explain the LIMTIP methodology more thoroughly, including its assumptions and limitations.
   - Include sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results under different assumptions.
       - Perhaps play around the Redistributing policies
       - Or the Time poverty threshold
  
3. Improve statistical analysis:

   - Provide confidence intervals or standard errors for key estimates.
       - CI's may be difficult
   - Conduct formal statistical tests to compare outcomes across different scenarios.
       - Yes, could be useful
  
4. Enhance the discussion section:
   - Relate findings more explicitly to existing literature and theories.
   - Discuss limitations of the study more thoroughly.

5. Improve structure and formatting:
   - Reorganize sections to follow a more standard academic paper format (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
  
6.  Consider adding a theoretical model:
    - Develop a simple economic model to formalize the relationship between time allocation, household production, and poverty.
