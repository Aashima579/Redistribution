## Introduction

- Time poverty is a critical yet often overlooked dimension of well-being. It refers to the lack of time for essential activities such as self-care, household responsibilities, and leisure. 

- Traditional poverty measures focus on income, but time poverty can significantly impact individuals' quality of life and overall welfare.

- In this study we use The Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP) to evaluate how redistributing of household production responsibilities can alleviate time poverty.
 
  - Three distinct redistribution scenarios and their impacts

::: {.notes}
- Emphasize the importance of considering time alongside income in poverty measures
- Mention that this study focuses on the United States
- Highlight that redistribution is examined within households, particularly between men and women
:::

## What is LIMTIP?

The Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP) is an approach that:

- Incorporates the dimension of time into traditional poverty measures
- Allow us to identify the "hidden poor" - those who appear non-poor by income but are time-poor given their responsibilities and constraints (how much they need to "buy" time to meet their needs)
- It combines data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of poverty

::: {.notes}
- LIMTIP was developed by the Levy Economics Institute
- It provides a more comprehensive understanding of poverty
- The hidden poor are often overlooked in traditional poverty measures
:::

## Time Balance Equation

The core of LIMTIP is the time balance equation:

$$X_{ij} = 168 - M - \alpha_{ij}R_j-D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij})$$

Where:

- $X_{ij}$: Time left after required activities
- $M$: Personal maintenance time
- $\alpha_{ij}R_j$: Individual's share of household responsibilities
- $D_{ij}(L_{ij}+T_{ij})$: Time spent on paid work and commuting

::: {.notes}
- 168 represents the total hours in a week
- Personal maintenance includes activities like sleeping and eating
- Negative $X_{ij}$ indicates time poverty
:::

## Household Time Poverty

LIMTIP considers household-level time poverty:

$$X_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{I_j} \min(X_{ij},0)$$

- A household is time-poor if at least one member has a time deficit
- This assumes no redistribution of responsibilities among household members
- It captures the household's overall time stress

::: {.notes}
- This approach recognizes that time poverty affects the entire household
- It's possible for some members to have time surpluses while others have deficits
- This formula sums up all individual time deficits in the household
:::

## LIMTIP Poverty Line

LIMTIP adjusts the official poverty line to account for time deficits:

$$Z_{j}^{adj} = Z_{j} + 52*P* |X_{j}|$$

Where:

- $Z_{j}$: Official poverty line
- $P$: Price used to monetize time deficits
- $52*P* |X_{j}|$: Annual cost of buying out time deficits

This adjustment helps identify the "hidden poor" - those who fall below the adjusted poverty line.

::: {.notes}
- $P$ is based on the average hourly wage for the private household industry
- The adjustment represents the cost of outsourcing household production to eliminate time deficits
- This captures the full extent of poverty, considering both time and income dimensions
:::

## LIMTIP Estimates for the U.S.

Analysis of U.S. data from 2005-2022 reveals:

- 38.7% of individuals live in time-poor households
- Among those in time-poor households:
  - 52.1% are themselves time-poor
  - 6% are "hidden poor" (non-poor by official measures, poor by LIMTIP)
- Time poverty is more prevalent among women (58%) than men (46%) in couples

::: {.notes}
- These figures highlight the significance of time poverty in the U.S.
- The gender disparity in time poverty reflects unequal distribution of household responsibilities
- The hidden poor represent a significant group overlooked by traditional poverty measures
:::

## Household Classification

For the redistribution analysis, households are classified into:

1. Non-Time Poor (61.3%): No time-poor members
2. Single Person Eligible (5.1%): Only one working-age, non-disabled member
3. Household Type I (1.4%): All members are time-poor
4. Household Type II (5.2%): At least one non-time poor member, but cannot eliminate household time poverty
5. Household Type III (27.0%): Can potentially eliminate household time poverty through redistribution

::: {.notes}
- Focus of the study is on Types I, II, and III
- Type III households have the most potential for improvement through redistribution
- The classification helps in understanding the different contexts of time poverty
:::

## Redistribution Scenarios

The study explores three redistribution scenarios:

1. Equal Shares: Divides household production time equally
2. Time Available: Distributes based on individual time availability
3. Opportunity Cost: Assigns shares based on earning potential

Each scenario represents a different principle of fairness or efficiency.

::: {.notes}
- These scenarios are theoretical and used to understand potential impacts
- They represent different philosophical approaches to household work distribution
- The goal is to compare outcomes and identify the most effective approach
:::

## Scenario 1: Equal Shares

Equal Shares scenario distributes household production equally:

$$\alpha_{ij}^E= \frac{1}{I_j}*(1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})$$

Where:

- $I_j$: Number of working-age persons in household
- $\alpha_{j}^{nw}$: Total share of non-working age members

This approach emphasizes equality but ignores individual circumstances.

::: {.notes}
- This is the simplest approach to redistribution
- It may not be the most efficient or fair in all cases
- Could potentially increase time poverty for some while alleviating it for others
:::

## Scenario 2: Time Available

Time Available scenario distributes based on individual time availability:

$$\alpha_{ij}^A = \frac{Z_{ij}}{\sum Z_{ij}} (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})$$

Where $Z_{ij}$ is available time after personal maintenance and income generation.

This approach aims for equity in time distribution.

::: {.notes}
- This scenario considers individual circumstances
- It tries to balance the time burden across household members
- May be more equitable but could be complex to implement in reality
:::

## Scenario 3: Opportunity Cost

Opportunity Cost scenario distributes based on earning potentials:

$$\alpha_{ij}^O = \frac{rw_{ij}}{\sum rw_{ij}} (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw})$$

Where $rw_{ij}$ is the inverse of individual (predicted) wages.

This approach aims to allocate responsibilities based on economic efficiency.

::: {.notes}
- Based on economic efficiency principles
- Could potentially increase household income but may reinforce gender inequalities
- Requires estimating potential wages for non-working members

:::{.small-text}
- Scenario 1 (Equal Shares) has the highest impact on men's time poverty
- Scenario 2 (Time Available) shows similar impacts across genders
- Scenario 3 (Opportunity Cost) affects women more than men
:::

::: {.notes}
- Transition rates show the percentage of individuals moving into or out of time poverty
- Results vary significantly across household types
- In Type III households, all scenarios show high poverty exit rates

## Changes in LIMTIP Poverty

![Changes in poverty estimates across redistribution scenarios](resources_brief/hh_pov.png)

:::{.small-text}
- All scenarios reduce the incidence of hidden poor
- Scenario 2 (Time Available) is most effective in reducing hidden poverty
- Type I households show little improvement or even increased LIMTIP poverty
:::

::: {.notes}
- LIMTIP poverty includes both income poverty and time poverty
- Hidden poor are those who are not income-poor but are time-poor
- Results highlight the importance of considering both time and income in poverty measures
:::

## Key Findings

- Redistribution can significantly reduce time poverty, especially in households with time surpluses
- The equity-based approach (Scenario 2) is most effective overall in reducing poverty rates
- Gender disparities in time poverty can be reduced through redistribution

::: {.notes}
- Emphasize that no single approach works best for all household types
- Highlight the potential of redistribution in addressing gender inequalities
- Mention that redistribution alone may not solve time poverty in all cases
:::

## Policy Implications

The findings suggest several policy considerations:

- Intra-household redistribution can be an effective tool for reducing time poverty
- Context-specific approaches are needed, considering household composition and circumstances
- Targeted redistribution policies may be more effective than one-size-fits-all approaches
- Analysis of household production composition could inform more detailed public policies

::: {.notes}
- Discuss potential challenges in implementing redistribution policies
- Mention the need for cultural shifts alongside policy changes
- Suggest areas for future research, such as impact on child well-being or economic productivity
:::

## Conclusion

This study on time poverty and household production redistribution reveals:

- Time poverty affects 38.7% of individuals in time-poor households
- Redistribution can significantly reduce time poverty and hidden poverty
- No single redistribution approach works best for all households
- Time poverty should be considered alongside income in poverty alleviation strategies

::: {.notes}
- Reiterate the importance of considering time poverty in policy discussions
- Emphasize the potential of redistribution but also its limitations
- Suggest directions for future research and policy development
