\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Redistribution of household production, which includes unpaid caregiving
and domestic chores, has been identified as an important tool to achieve
gender equality. The incorporation of the 3R (recognizition, reduction
adn redistribution) strategy as a target in the sustainable development
goals, is a testament to the decades of activism and advocacy
emphasizing that inequality on this front cannot be justified in the
name of ``private family matter'' rather is a matter of public policy.
While redistribution of household production responsibilities from women
to men is important intrsinsically for human rights and fairness
concerns, it is also instrumental in achieving gender equality in labor
market outcomes (Bruyn-Hundt, 1996; Elso, 2017; Esquivel, 2016). Studies
have demonstrated that gender gaps in the workforce and the unequal
sharing of household responsibilities can severely impede economic
growth and development (Berik et al., 2009; Duflo, 2012; Elson, 2009)).
Yet, difficult questions remain about public policies and collective
actions that would reduce inequality, especially in poorer countries
with constrained fiscal capacity,widespread absence of formal wage labor
and weak welfare states. Moreover, in patrirachal contexts, cultural
barriers restrict redistribution of household production, particularly
unpaid care work from women to men and to the public and private
spheres. While in some developed countries such as Norway and Sweden,
public policies have been able to promote gender -equitable sharing of
household production, for eg: paid paternity leaves in addition to paid
maternity leaves , such policies seem to have attained limited consensus
in other countries.

In the case of the US, issues related to lack of public prpovisioning of
care infrastructure and services, persistence of childcare deserts, lack
of paid parental leave laws among others have gained momentum.

In 2021, the value of unpaid household work in the U.S. amounted to
\$600 billion, constituting approximately 2.6\% of the GDP (Reinhard et
al.~2023). Moreover, like most other countries, we observe gender
disparity in sharing of household work such that women
disproportionately shoulder the burden. According to the 2018 American
Time Use Survey, among adults aged 15 and older, women on average spent
5.7 hours per day on unpaid household and care work, compared with 3.6
hours for men. In other words, women spent 37 percent more time on
unpaid household and care work than men (Hess et al., 2020).
Additionally, the U.S. falls behind many OECD countries in effective
childcare policies, spending only 0.4\% of GDP on early childhood
education and care (ECEC), compared to the OECD average of 0.8\% (OECD,
2020). Notably, the U.S. lacks federal laws granting paid parental
leave, setting it apart from other OECD nations. Around 51\% of the U.S.
population resides in childcare deserts, defined as census tracts with
more than 50 children under the age of 5 and either no childcare
providers or significantly limited options, resulting in a severe
shortage of licensed child care slots (Malik et al., 2018). In the above
setting, care demand falls onto the households, partculalrly women. This
in turn restricts care providers allocation of time to other activities
including employment, leisure, socializing and self care. Time-trade off
are crucial in determining individual's well-being. While some
hosuheolds may be able to outsource some of these care needs, other
income-constraint hosueholds may not be able to. Over the last two
decades, there has been growing interest in studying time and income
poverty and in developing their linkages (Levy studies). Time
constraints that stem from the overlapping domains of paid and unpaid
work are of central concern to the debates surrounding economic
development and gender equality. In this backdrop, we develop a novel
measure of poverty for the U.S. that incorporates time deficits, known
as the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP). The
topic of time poverty due to household production is gaining attention
in the U.S given the persisting lack of publicly provided care,
affordable child and elderly care, and limited paid parental leave
benefits. The associated time deficits constrain people's time
allocation in a range of activities, in turn affecting their overall
well-being, productivity, labor market participation, and earnings. The
consequences are particularly serious for women due to the
disproportionate burden of household responsibilities they bear, which
are closely intertwined with labor market and well-being outcomes.
Standard measures of poverty fail to capture hardships caused by time
deficits and thereby do not provide a complete picture for effective
poverty-alleviation and welfare programs. Understanding the incidence of
time poverty that individuals face and how that may have implications
for the study of poverty, gender equality and overall development is
therefore important.

\section{LIMTIP: A New Measure of Time Poverty for the United
States}\label{limtip-a-new-measure-of-time-poverty-for-the-united-states}

\end{itemize}

Poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond the simple notion
of lack of income. In addition to income, poverty can be understood as a
lack of access to resources, including time. The LIMTIP is a metric that
incorporates in addition to income poverty, aspects of time poverty.
Time poverty refers to a scenarion wherein people may not have any time
left after engaging in activities that are essential for taking care of
the household, its members, self-care, and paid work (!leisure also?).

As with any other measures of poverty, it is necessary to identify a
threshold to determine if given the resources available to a person or
household, they should be classified as poor or non-poor. In the case of
time, all individuals have the same amount of time available to them i.e
24 hours in a day, therefore, thinking about a threshold is less
intuitive. Instead, the approach used for the construction of the LIMTIP
has been to identify the time balance people would potentially face
after considering the necessary time spent on essential activities and
household responsabilities. In this framework, people with a negative
balance are considered time-poor. We express the weekly time balance of
individual \(i\) in household \(j\), \(X_{ij}\), as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bal}{X_{ij} = 168 - M - \alpha_{ij}R_j-D_{ij}^0(L_{ij}+T_{ij})
}\end{equation}

where 168 is the number of hours in a week, \(M\) is the sum of personal
care and non-substitutable household production requirements, \(R_j\) is
the required time of household production that a family \(j\) needs to
maintain the household, \(\alpha_{ij}\) is the share of individual \(i\)
in the household production requirements. To account for required time
due to working, the eq-bal also includes \(D_{ij}\), a dummy variable
that takes a value of 1 if the person is employed and zero otherwise.
Thus, for those employed, one also accounts for hours of employment
\(L_{ij}\) , the hours of commuting \(T_{ij}\).

To construct this measure, we need a dataset that contains information
on individuals' time use, in addition to standard information required
for poverty analysis. The main source of information for time use comes
from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which only provides
information for a single person in the household and a single day. We
understook a statitical matching procedure to combine time use data from
ATUS to the Annual Social and Economic Supplements (ASEC) data. It is
necessary to combine the ATUS with the ASEC data to construct a
synthetic dataset that contains information on time use for all
household members, which will allow us to impute all required variables
for eq-bal.

Using the the matched data we then construct income and time poverty
estimates for the individuals and households in the United States for
the years 2005 to 2022. Note that we classify a household as time poor,
if atleast one working age member experiences time deficit.

The LIMTIP is finally measured as:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-limtip}{P_{j}^L* = P_{j}^O- p_{j}*X_{j}
}\end{equation}

The underlying idea is that if we were to monetize the time deficits of
individuals and add those to the offical income poverty thresholds, we
get an adjusted poverty line - LIMTIP. The LIMTIP estimates can be
classified into four braod categories: Income poor,time poor, (ii)Income
poor, time non-poor; (iii) Income non-poor, time poor; and (iv) Income
non-poor, time non-poor. In Table~\ref{tbl-limtip} we present the
distribution of individuals and households across the four-way
classification of LIMTIP, averaged out across years 2005 to 2022.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-limtip}\textbf{Four-way classification, LIMTIP }}

\centering{

[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \hline
        Four-way classification, LIMTIP & Individual & Household \\ \hline
        Income Poor, Time Poor & 3.46 & 6.03  \\ 
        Income Poor, Time Nonpoor & 11.94 & 9.75  \\ 
        Income Nonpoor, Time Poor & 21.71 & 39.39  \\ 
        Income Nonpoor, Time Nonpoor & 62.89 & 44.83  \\ \hline
        Time poor (1+3) & 25.17 & 45.42  \\ \hline
        LIMTIP poor (1+2) & 15.40 & 15.78  \\ \hline
        N & ~ & ~ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

Moreover, the estimation of LIMTIP helps us calculate the number of
hidden poor, i.e time poor indivuals who are left outside the scope of
official income poverty estimates. The difference between the LIMTIP
measure of poverty and the official poverty estimates give us the number
of hidden poor.

In Figure~\ref{fig-trend} we present time trend from 2005 to 2023 of
time poverty estimates, the offical income poverty trend, and the LIMTIP
poverty trend. We observe that the official poverty estimates shows a
slight rising trend between 2005 to 2014 and then starts to decline.
When we adjust for time deficits, as expected our LIMTIP estimates shows
a higher level of poverty across all years, around 3-5 percentage points
higher. For the LIMTIP poverty estimates, we observe that the pandemic
years show some steep decline from 13.8 \% in 2020 to 10\% in 2022
before rising back to the pre-pandemic level of around 15\%. Moreover,
it is notable that time poverty peaked around the Great Recession and
Covid-19 pandemic recession. While time poverty rate has remained more
or less stable until 2019, it fell slightly in 2020 before rising again
between 2020 to 2023. In the latest year, 2023, nearly 3.5 percent of
individuals are hidden poor.

In the next section, we focus on the subsample that can potentially be
brought out of poverty.

\section{Identifying the Problem}\label{sec-problem}

One of the strategies that could help reducing the problem of time
poverty, and thereby the incidence of hidden poor, is the redistribution
of household production responsibilities across all capable (!add
footnote on capable!) members in the household. At best, household
members with time surpluses could take on more household
responsabilities, reducing the burden of those with time deficits, and
potentially bringing out household out of poverty. At worst, the
redistribution could make the time deficits more equal among the
household members, even if the household remains time poor.

Before we start analyzing the potential that redistribution could have
in reducing time poverty, we must first identify the households where
redistribution is possible and desirable. Specifically, we exclude from
the analysis households that are not time poor, even if such households
could potentially benefit from redistribution, reducing the gaps of time
surpluses among household members and even resulting in more
gender-equitable sharing of household work. From the sample of
individuals living in a time poor household we classify them into five
different groups:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Single: These are time poor individuals that live in a household where
  they are the only working-age person. In this case, redistribution is
  not possible, and thus are excluded from the analysis.
\item
  Time Poor living in H. Type I: These are time poor individuals who
  live in households where all working-age members are time poor. While
  redistribution is possible, and may help in reducing the time deficits
  of individuals, and even allow some to transition out of time poverty,
  the household will remain time poor in any redistributional scenario.
\item
  Time Poor living in H. Type II: These are time poor individuals who
  live in households where there are non-time poor individuals. However,
  the combined time surpluses is insufficient to lift the household out
  of time poverty.
\item
  Time Poor living in H. Type III: These are time poor individuals who
  live in households where there is enough time surplus to lift the
  household out of time poverty. Redistribution in these households can
  lift all working members of the household out of time poverty.
\item
  Non Time poor living in a time poor household: This last group
  consists of individuals with time surpluses living in a time poor
  household. The goal of the redistribution scenarios is to allocate
  household responsabilities in such a way that these invididuals can
  help lift other household members out of time poverty. However, it is
  also possible that some of these individuals may end up experiencing
  time poverty in the redistribution scenarios. (!present this info in a
  table across columns: Red possibile or not and efficient or not/or
  what outcome it brings in, by hhtype)
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig-composition} provides a visual representation of the
classification of individuals living in time poor households. As it can
be observed, across years, about 40\% of individuals were living in a
time poor household. While this share shows a sharp increase between
2005 and 2007, it has remained stable from 2008 onwards, with a small
increase across years. There is an additional 4-5\% of individuals who
are time poor but redistribution is not possible. From the rest, about
15\% of individuals constitute our main group of analysis, i.e., those
living in households where redistribution is possible and some
individuals could benefit from it. The remaining 20\% are individuals
who are not time poor but live in a time poor household.

\end{figure}%

In the next section, we discuss three redistribution scenarios wherein
household responsabilities can redistributed across working-age members,
under different criteria. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that we
will only be analyzing the impact of redistribution on time poor
households with at least 2 working-age members.

\section{Redistribution Scenarios}\label{redistribution-scenarios}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Here we would describe the three redistribution scenarios we have
  developed. This would be ``realistic'' scenarios.
\item
  Describe the scenarios and the assumptions behind them.
\end{itemize}

Intrahousehold redistribution can potentially reduce time deficits and
bring households out of poverty. We construct three redistrubution
scenarios based on different guiding principles. The extent of the
reduction would depend on the principle that we use in distributing
household responsibilities among the members. First, we use the simple
egalitarianism principle that involves an equal division of total
household productiom time among all working age members. Second, we
redistribute conditional on the available time people have. In the thord
scenario, we redsitribute based on the opportunity cost of time for
people.

We outline the methods used for implementing the principles in our data,
with the detailed explanation of some aspects below.

\subsection{Distribution Rules for Household
Production}\label{distribution-rules-for-household-production}

Alternative values of \(\alpha_{ij}\) indicate how household production
requirements, net of the portion met by household members that are not
of working age or are physically unable to take on more work, are shared
among working-age people in the household. The three principles are:

\subsubsection{Equal Shares Principle}\label{equal-shares-principle}

The procedure for the equal shares scenario is relatively simple. Recall
that the shares of those in the redistribution simulation in this
scenario are simply:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r1}{\alpha_{ij}^E= 1/I_j*(1-\alpha_{j}^{nw'})
}\end{equation}

where \(\alpha_{ij}\) represents the redistributed share of individual
\(i\); \(I^j\) denote the number of working-age persons in household
\(j\) and \(\alpha_{j}^{nw'}\) represents the share of non-working
group, hence \((1-\alpha_{j}^{nw'})\) representing the available
redistributable share. We count how many people are in the
redistribution simulation in each household and then assign them the
appropriate fraction (1 for households with one person in the
simulation, 1⁄2 for households with two people in the simulation, and so
on) and apply that fraction to the redistributable share of required
household production time. This scenraio overlooks time equity, i.e
redistributes without taking into consideration the time available to
individuals.

\subsubsection{Time Available Principle}\label{time-available-principle}

The time available scenario is based on equity such that the
redistrubted shares are based on the time that is available after
setting aside the time for personal maintenance requirements and income
generation. In other words, the household members should split up the
required household production time based on the time each one has
available, i.e based on an equity criteria. The time available
(\(Z_{ij}\)) is defined as the time left over after the minimum personal
maintenance and time spent on income generation (including commuting
time) have been subtracted from the total weekly hours. To calculate the
shares for each individual based on this principle, we first calculate
the time available for each individual, then add up the total among the
household for those individuals that have positive time available. We
then divide each individual's time available by the total and apply that
fraction to the redistributable share of household production time. For
those individuals that have negative time available we set their shares
to zero in this simulation.

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r2}{\alpha_{ij}^A= (Z_{ij}/ \sum Z_{ij}) (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw'}), if  Z_{ij}>0, 
}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r3}{\alpha_{ij}^A =0, if Z_{ij}<0
}\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Opportunity costs}\label{opportunity-costs}

The third possibility is based on the idea of opportunity costs along
marginalist lines. The sharing rule depends on the relative actual
(potential) wage. For example, if there are only two working-age adults,
say husband and wife, and if the husband's wage is twice as much as the
wife, the wife's share would be two-thirds and the husband's share would
be one-third. We use the actual or shadow wage for the employed and the
potential wage for the nonemployed. Redistribution takes place based on
the following equation:
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r3}{\alpha_{ij}^O= (1/{I_j-1})*(1-w_{ij}/w_{ij} ) (1-\alpha_{j}^{nw'})
}\end{equation}

First, we imputed wages for all of those not currently working for pay.
In order to do this, we used a two-stage Heckman selection model
(Heckman 1979), also known as the Heckit procedure, which we outline
below. Once done, we used the imputed wages of those that are not
currently working for pay and the actual wages of those that are working
to divide up the redistributable share of required household production.

As the share of required household production needs to be inversely
proportional to the individual's share of the sum of wages, we subtract
their share of this sum from one. To ensure that the resulting shares
sum up to unity, we divide by the number of individuals in the
simulation minus one. We then apply this share to the redistributable
share of required household production as in previous steps. In order to
impute wages for those not currently employed for wages, we first impute
the likeliest industry and occupation for each individual using a
multinomial probit procedure. Industry and occupation are regressed on
age, age squared, sex, race, education, and geographic region on all
those in the working age population (18-64). The likelihood for each
industry and occupation is then predicted for everyone, using the
results of the multinomial probit. Then each individual not currently
working for wages is assigned the industry and occupation corresponding
to the xxxx/ largest predicted likelihoods for that individual.

Next, we move on to the first stage of the Heckit procedure, a probit
estimation of a dummy variable for being employed in wage work (paid):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-probit}{P(paid=1|X)=F(X \beta)
}\end{equation}

where F is the cumulative density function of a normal distribution. The
vector of explanatory variables, 𝑋, comprises the individual's age, sex,
race, disability, number of kids across age groups (0 to 5, 6 to 14,
15-17), presence of spouse and spouse's age, education and employment
status education. The regression is run on the universe of all eligible
adults separately by age (divided into four categories: 18 to 30 years
old; 31 to 45 years old; and 46 to 64 years old) and sex. The Mills
ratio, 𝜆, is calculated for all individuals using the results of the
first stage regression:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-mills}{\lambda = f(X\beta)/ F(X\beta)
}\end{equation}

where 𝑓 and 𝐹 are, respectively, the probability and cumulative density
function of a normal distribution, and \(\beta\) is the vector of
estimated coefficients from the probit model. The second stage is an
ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of the log of hourly wage:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-OLS}{lnw= (\gamma_2*Z^w) + (\theta_2 \lambda) + \mu
}\end{equation}

This regression is run only on those that are actually employed for pay
(!FRA). The vector of explanatory variables, {[}{]}, includes age, sex,
race, education, geographical region, disability, industry, occupation,
presence of spouse, spouse's employment status, and, finally, λ, the
Mills ratio calculated in the first stage. Inclusion of the Mills ratio
corrects for the selection bias induced by limiting the regression to
those in paid employment. The imputed log of wage is predicted for those
not working for wages from the results of the regression, with industry
and occupation replaced by the industries and occupations assigned in
the previous step.

We simulate each of these principles of redistribution and recalculate
individual and household time and income poverty using the LIMTP
framework described above.

\begin{itemize}

  Next, we provide an assessment of the different principles in terms of
  how far they improve the position of women and how much such
  improvements are congruent with the betterment of the economic
  well-being of their families. In the subsequent section, we compare
  and contrast the joint distribution of time and income poverty among
  families and individuals that would result from each principle.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}\label{results}

As described in the previous section, we consider three scenarios to
analyze the impact that redistribution could have on time poverty,
focusing on individuals living in time poor households with at least two
working-age members. In this section, we present the results of the
redistribution scenarios and discuss the implications for time poverty
and the incidence of hidden poor. Since most of the results acrosstime
(see online appendix) are similar, we focus on providing results that
average the impacts of redistribution across all years.

\subsection{Redistribution Scenarios and Time Poverty: General
Results}\label{redistribution-scenarios-and-time-poverty-general-results}

Based on the imputed data, and considering people in working age only,
55 out of 100 individuals that live in time poor households are not time
poor themselves. 4.6 live in households where everyone is time poor,

To understand the impact of the diferent redistribution scenarios on
this groups, we will focus on transition probabilities. Thus, for those
out of poverty, our statistic of interest would be the likelihood that
they fall back into poverty, and for those in poverty, the likelihood
that they transition out of poverty.

Of course, the scenarios also have implications in terms of time poverty
gap (time deficits). As shown in

analyzing the impact on time poverty across different demographic
groups.
