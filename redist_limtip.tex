\# Introduction

Redistribution of household production has been identified as an
important tool to achieve gender equality (Elson The incorporation of
the 3R (recognizition, reduction adn redistribution) strategy as a
target in the sustainable development goals, is a testament to the
decades of activism and advocacy emphasizing that inequality on this
front cannot be justified in the name of ``private family matter''
rather is a matter of public policy. While redistribution of household
production responsibilities from females to males is important
intrsinsically for human rights and fairness concerns, it is also
instrumental in achieving gender equality in labor market outcomes
(Bruyn-Hundt 1996; Elson 2017; Esquivel 2016). Yet, difficult questions
remain about public policies and collective actions that would reduce
inequality, especially in poorer countries. A limited consensus seems to
have emerged regarding the effectiveness of certain policy initiatives
(e.g., paid paternity leave). But, many of them are likely to have only
limited efficacy in the poorer countries due to their structural
features such as the widespread absence of formal wage labor and weak
welfare states. In the case of the US, issues related to lack of public
prpovisioning of care infrastructure and services, persistence of
childcare deserts, lack of paid parental leave laws among others have
gained momentum. In 2021, the value of unpaid care work in the U.S.
amounted to \$600 billion, constituting approximately 2.6\% of the GDP
(Reinhard et al.~2023). Moreover, like most other countries, we observe
gender disparity in sharing of household work such that Women
disproportionately shoulder the burden of unpaid care work. According to
the 2018 American Time Use Survey, among adults aged 15 and older, women
on average spent 5.7 hours per day on unpaid household and care work,
compared with 3.6 hours for men. In other words, women spent 37 percent
more time on unpaid household and care work than men (Hess \& Hayes
2020). Additionally, the U.S. falls behind many OECD countries in
childcare policies and outcomes, spending only 0.4\% of GDP on early
childhood education and care (ECEC), compared to the OECD average of
0.8\% (OECD 2020). Notably, the U.S. lacks federal laws granting paid
parental leave, setting it apart from other OECD nations. Around 51\% of
the U.S. population resides in childcare deserts, defined as census
tracts with more than 50 children under the age of 5 and either no
childcare providers or significantly limited options, resulting in a
severe shortage of licensed child care slots (Malik et al.~(2018). In
the above setting, care demand falls onto the household, partculalrly
women. This in turn restricts care providers allocation of time to other
activities including employment, leisure, socializing and self care.
Time-trade off are crucial determines individual's well-being. While
some hosuheolds may be able to outsource some of these care needs, other
income-constraint hosuehodls may not be able to. In the last two
decades, there has been growing interest in studying time and income
poverty and in developing their linkages (xx).

Time constraints that stem from the overlapping domains of paid and
unpaid work are of central concern to the debates surrounding economic
development and gender equality. In this backdrop, we develop a novel
measure of poverty for the U.S. that incorporates time deficits, known
as the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP). Time
deficits due to household production is gaining attention in the U.S
given the persisting lack of publicly provided care, affordable child
and elderly care, and limited paid parental leave benefits. These time
deficits constrain people's time allocation in a range of activities, in
turn affecting their overall well-being, productivity, labor market
participation, and earnings. The consequences are particularly serious
for women due to the disproportionate burden of household
responsibilities they bear, which are closely intertwined with labor
market and well-being outcomes. Standard measures of poverty fail to
capture hardships caused by time deficits and thereby do not provide a
complete picture for effective poverty-alleviation and welfare programs.
Understand the incidence of time poverty that individuals face and how
that may have implications for the study of poverty, gender equality and
overall development is therefore crucial.

\section{LIMTIP: A New Measure of Time Poverty for the United
States}\label{limtip-a-new-measure-of-time-poverty-for-the-united-states}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe the LIMTIP measure and how it is constructed: Methods paper
\item
  Brief description of the LIMTIP measure and the Hidden Poor in the US.
  Small section
\end{itemize}

Poverty is a multidimensional concept that goes beyond the simple notion
of lack of income. In addition to income, poverty can be understood as a
lack of access to resources, including time. LIMTIP is a metric that
incorporates in addition to income poverty, aspects of time poverty.
Time poverty refers to a scenarion wherein people may not have any time
left after engaging in activities that are essential for taking care of
the household, its members, self-care, and paid work (when appropriate).

As with any other measures of poverty, it is necessary to identify a
threshold to determine if given the resources available to a person or
household, they should be classified as poor or non-poor. In the case of
time, however, thinking about a threshold is less intuitive because all
individuals have the same amount of time available to them i.e 24 hours
in a day. Instead, the approach used for the construction of the LIMTIP
has been to identify the time balance people would potentially face
after considering the necessary time spent on essential activities and
household responsabilities. In this framework, people with a negative
balance are considered time-poor. We express the weekly time balance of
individual \(i\) in household \(j\), \(X_{ij}\), as:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-bal}{X_{ij} = 168 - M - \alpha_{ij}R_j-D_{ij}^0(L_{ij}+T_{ij})
}\end{equation}

where 168 is the number of hours in a week, \(M\) is the sum of personal
care and non-substitutable household production requirements, \(R_j\) is
the required time of household production that a family \(j\) needs to
maintain the household, \(\alpha_{ij}\) is the share of individual \(i\)
in the household production requirements. To account for required time
due to working, the Equation~\ref{eq-bal} also includes \(D_{ij}\), a
dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the person is employed and
zero otherwise. Thus, for those employed, one also accounts for hours of
employment \(L_{ij}\) , the hours of commuting \(T_{ij}\).

To construct this measure, we need a dataset that contains information
on individuals' time use, in addition to standard information required
for poverty analysis. The main source of information for time use comes
from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which only provides
information for a single person in the household and a single day. It is
necessary to combine the ATUS with the ASEC data to construct a
synthetic dataset that contains information on time use for all
household members, which will allow us to impute all required variables
for Equation~\ref{eq-bal}.

Using ATUS and ASEC data and utilzing statitical matching we develop
income and time poverty estimates for the United States for the years
2005 to 2022. In this policy brief we focus on discussing the LIMTIP
estimates for the year 2022.

The LIMTIP
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-limtip}{P_{j}^L* = P_{j}^O- p_{j}*X_{j}
}\end{equation}

The underlying idea is that if we were to monetize the time deficits of
individuals and add those to the offical income poverty thresholds, we
get an adjusted poverty line - LIMTIP. The estimation of LIMTIP helps us
calculate the number of hidden poor, i.e time poor indivuals who are
left outside the scope of official income poverty estimates. The
difference between the LIMTIP measure of poverty and the official
poverty estimates give us the number of hidden poor. For our US
estimates, we find that xx number of individuals are hidden poor in
2022. The time trend shows that hidden poor has xxxx over time. Further,
in Table xx and yy we present the distribution of individuals and hh
respectively across the four-way classification of LIMTIP (time poor and
i) for the year 2022.

Next, we develop three redistribution scenarios wherein we redistribute
the share of household production responsibilities among the household's
working-age persons while all else remains. In other words, we examine
the effects of a new set of values of \(\alpha_{ij}\). Redistribution
will change the magnitude of the time balanace in Equation~\ref{eq-bal}
and, depending on the extent and direction of the change, may result in
a time-poor person becoming time-nonpoor or a time-nonpoor person
experiencing time poverty. We focus on the subsample of households for
which redistribution is possible and efficient. For example
redistributing househodd prod in a hh with atleast one time poor and one
time non poor individual along with the constraint that redistribution
can take place to adults belonging to 18-64 years and who are able. This
allows for us to not redistribute hh pro to children and/or those with
ddisability.

\section{Identifying the Problem}\label{identifying-the-problem}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The problem we need to identify the problem of time-poverty caused by
  redistribution (or lack thereof) of household production.
\item
  Identify either: how many Time poor individuals live in household with
  time non-poor adults.
\item
  Or identify the baseline of time poverty if there is full flexibility
  for time allocation. (Household Deficit consider both time deficits
  and surpluses)
\end{itemize}

This would give us a fist look at how much poverty could be alleviated
if household production was redistributed.

We could even look at Who are this individuals who are living in time
poverty, but that Do not need to. (describe the characteristics of these
individuals)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Added value. This will help us identify those who cannot be helped by
  redistribution of household production. (even if their incidence
  changes
\item
  This raises the question. Do we want to analyze redistribution in
  household that are not time poor?
\end{itemize}

\section{Redistribution Scenarios}\label{redistribution-scenarios}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Here we would describe the three redistribution scenarios we have
  developed. This would be ``realistic'' scenarios.
\item
  Describe the scenarios and the assumptions behind them.
\end{itemize}

Intrahousehold redistribution can potentially reduce time deficits. We
construct three redistrubution scenarios based on different guiding
principles udnerlying the mechanism of redistribution. The extent of the
reduction would depend on the principle that we use in distributing
household responsibilities among the members. First, we use the simple
egalitarianism principle that involves an equal division. B

xxxx We also briefly outline the methods used for implementing the
principles in our data, with the detailed explanation of some aspects
provided in Appendix xx. Next, we provide an assessment of the different
principles in terms of how far they improve the position of women and
how much such improvements are congruent with the betterment of the
economic well-being of their families. In the subsequent section, we
compare and contrast the joint distribution of time and consumption
poverty among families and individuals that would result from each
principle.

\subsection{Distribution Rules for Household
Production}\label{distribution-rules-for-household-production}

Alternative values of \(\alpha_{ij}\) indicate how household production
requirements, net of the portion met by household members that are not
of working age or are physically unable to take on more work, are shared
between working-age persons in the household. Below we discuss the three
principles. \#\#\# 1. Equal Shares Scenario The procedure for the equal
shares scenario is relatively simple. Recall that the shares of those in
the redistribution simulation in this scenario are simply: As before,
denoting the number of working-age persons in household \(j\) as
\(I^j\), we can express the rule as: xxx

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-r1}{$\alpha_{ij}$^E= 1/$I^j$ 
}\end{equation}

\subsubsection{2. Time Available Scenario (WIP
editing)}\label{time-available-scenario-wip-editing}

The time available scenario is based on the principle that household
members should split up the required household production time based on
the time each one has available, i.e based on an equity criteria. The
time available (\(Z_{ij}\))) is defined as the time left over after the
minimum personal maintenance and time spent on income generation
(including commuting time) have been subtracted from the total weekly
hours. To calculate the shares for each individual based on this
principle, we first calculate the time available for each individual,
then add up the total among the household for those individuals that
have positive time available. We then divide each individual's time
available by the total and apply that fraction to the redistributable
share of household production time.

The second principle is based on equity such that the redistrubted
shares are based on the time that is available after setting aside the
time for personal maintenance requirements and income generation. This
principle accounts for the time available to individuals, fo eg: some
people may have such exceptionally long hours at the job that after
meeting the minimum personal maintenance requirements they are left with
no time to devote to household production requirements. We described
them as being in purely job-induced time poverty. Because we are
assuming that the time spent on employment remains constant, the logical
approach would be to set the value of time available to zero for those
in job-induced time poverty in figuring out the time available to the
household as a whole and individuals shares:

The third possibility is based on the idea of opportunity costs along
marginalist lines. The sharing rule depends on the relative actual
(potential) wage. For example, if there are only two working-age adults,
say husband and wife, and if the husband's wage is twice as much as the
wife, the wife's share would be two-thirds and the husband's share would
be one-third. Thus:

We simulate each of these principles of redistribution and recalculate
individual and household time and consumption poverty using the LIMTP
framework described above.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Compare the time poverty changes on those identified earlier.
\item
  Moreover, we examine the changes by sex, employment status, presence
  of children in the household.
\item
  Perhaps Start with a global analysis (without Specific groups)
\item
  then Analyze the case for Specific groups
\end{itemize}

Perhaps provide more emphasis on Some of the groups (gender, the
employed, parents?)

\subsection{Gender Disparity in the Incidence of Time
Deficits}\label{gender-disparity-in-the-incidence-of-time-deficits}

Evidence indicates that negative time balance values (i.e., time
deficits) occur mostly among employed persons Add table by sex and
employment status for limtip and discuss results. Further, presence of
children would demand more caregiving hours thereby putting a pressure
on time available, particulalrly for employed couples or single memebr
hosuehodls. Add table by sex and children for limtip and discuss
results.
