Time poverty is a critical yet overlooked dimension of poverty. While income poverty measures have long dominated policy discussions, the Levy Institute Measure of Time and Income Poverty (LIMTIP) aims to provide some light on the hidden poor - those who may have sufficient income to be "non-poor", based on the traditional poverty line, but lack the time to meet basic needs due to work and household responsibilities.

While work on understanding time poverty has been promoted by the Levy Economics Institute for some time [@zacharias2011], most of earlier work has focused on the experience of other developed countries, as well as developing countries.^[It should be noticed that the Levy has another flagship project [LIMEW](https://www.levyinstitute.org/topics/levy-institute-measure-of-economic-well-being-limew) that also considers time, but in the context of resources and well-being.] In a recent project report from the Levy Economics Institute, we make a first effort in attemtting to integrate information on time into the Consumer Expenditure Survey [@zacharias2024a], alebit with a focus on alternative measures of consumption. 

In this blog post, we summarize the key findings from a recent work in progress policy brief that explores how redistributing household production responsibilities could alleviate time poverty in the United States. Using LIMTIP data, which synthetically joins data from the Current Population Survey (ASEC-CPS) and the American Time use Survey (ATUS), the brief explores three redistribution scenarios and their potential impacts on time poverty rates and household well-being.

## The Hidden Poor: Time Poverty in the U.S.

The LIMTIP measure reveals that time poverty is a significant issue in the United States, affecting 42.9% of individuals living in time-poor households (@tbl-limtip). Interestingly, time-poor households have lower official income poverty rates (6%) compared to non-time-poor households (17.9%). This suggests a trade-off where households prioritize income generation over time availability.

However, when accounting for the monetized value of time deficits^[This could be understood as the amount of income required to "hire" some one to fullfill responsabilities, the household is unable to meet.], the LIMTIP adjusted poverty rate for time-poor households rises to 13.1%. This 7.1 percentage point difference represents the hidden poor - those whose income appears sufficient but falls short when considering the resources needed to outsource time-intensive responsibilities.

Poverty Rates by Household Time Poverty Status

## Redistribution Scenarios

The ongoing research, and previous findings for other countries experiences, have suggested that one of the factors explaining time poverty and the hidden poor is the unequal distribution of responsabilities across household members. As a way to evaluate this premise in the US case, we consider three scenarios for redistributing household production responsibilities:

1. Equal Shares: Dividing tasks equally among all working-age household members.
2. Time Available: Allocating responsibilities based on each member's available time after accounting for personal maintenance and paid work.
3. Opportunity Cost: Assigning tasks inversely proportional to each member's earning potential.

These scenarios were applied to different time-poor household, considering only working age (18-64) and able individuals. To measure the impact of redistribution, we analyzed transition rates between time poverty statuses and changes in time deficits across scenarios.

## Impact on Time Poverty

The redistribution scenarios show promising results in reducing time poverty, particularly for households where time surpluses exceed deficits. However, the effects vary across household types and scenarios.

### Transition Rates

For couples, the equal shares scenario (Scenario 1) has the highest impact on pushing non-time-poor men into time poverty (26.1%), while having a smaller effect on women (8.3%) (@fig-transition1 and @fig-transition2). This reflects the current unequal distribution of household responsibilities.

The time available scenario (Scenario 2) shows more balanced effects, with similar transition rates for men and women. Interestingly, the opportunity cost scenario (Scenario 3) leads to higher transition rates into time poverty for women (19.8%) compared to men (14.2%), likely due to wage disparities.[^ Transitions rates into time-poverty occur when a non-time-poor individual becomes time-poor, after redistribution.]

For households where everyone is already time-poor (Type I), redistribution has limited impact. However, in households with at least one non-time-poor member (Type II and III), the scenarios show significant potential for reducing time poverty, especially for women.

### Changes in Time Deficits

Beyond transition rates, we also examine changes in the magnitude of time deficits. For couples, redistribution generally leads to smaller time deficits for women and increased deficits for men, promoting more equitable sharing of responsibilities.

In Type III households (where redistribution can eliminate time poverty), all scenarios significantly reduce time deficits. The time available scenario (Scenario 2) proves most effective, with nearly all couples exiting time poverty.

## Impact on LIMTIP Poverty

Redistribution scenarios also show potential for reducing the incidence of hidden poor. As @fig-limtip1 illustrates, all scenarios decrease the share of hidden poor from 5.7% to 1-2% across all household types combined.

The time available scenario (Scenario 2) emerges as the most effective in reducing hidden poverty. However, for households where all members are time-poor (Type I), redistribution may sometimes increase LIMTIP poverty due to limited room for reallocation.

## Policy Implications

The findings suggest that intra-household redistribution of household production could be an effective tool for reducing time deficits and alleviating time poverty. However, there are several points to consider:

- **Context matters**: The effectiveness of redistribution policies depends on household composition and existing time poverty status.

- **Equity-based** approach shows promise: The time available scenario (Scenario 2) emerged as most effective in reducing poverty rates and enabling individuals to exit poverty.

- **Gender equity**: Redistribution promotes more equitable sharing of household responsibilities between men and women.

- **Targeted approaches** needed: Policies aiming to promote redistribution should aim to focus on specific groups, such as couples with children, or household in working age.

## Where do we go from here?

As we write the final version of the policy brief, and this blog post, we are considering few points for further research:

- **Composition of household production**: Currently, household production is assumed to be fully homogenous concept. However, analyzing the specific types of tasks being redistributed could inform more targeted policies (e.g., childcare provision vs. general housework).

2. **Age-specific impacts**: One limitation of the redistribution setup was that it does not discriminate by age, thus potentially promoting more house work responsabilities for the young or the older members of the household. Examining how redistribution affects younger vs. older household members could help avoid unintended consequences.

3. **Cultural factors**: A big component of the drivers of household responsabilities across their members is driven by cultural and social factors. It is important to understand how such attitudes and norms influeces household production distributions, or redistribution efforts.

## Conclusion

This note summarizes the often-overlooked issue of time poverty and its impact on household well-being. By incorporating time deficits into poverty measures, the LIMTIP reveals a significant share of the population to be *hidden* poor, as they struggle to meet basic needs despite having incomes above official poverty thresholds.

Redistributing household production responsibilities shows promise as a strategy for alleviating time poverty, particularly in households where time surpluses can absorb deficits. The equity-based approach, which allocates tasks based on available time, is the most effective in reducing both time and LIMTIP poverty rates.

However, the varying effects across household types and scenarios indicate that that any policies will need to be context-specific. While redistribution can promote gender equity and improve overall household well-being, it should be considered as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing both time and income poverty.
